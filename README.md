This package adds tools to be used with astropy to explore variable speed of light (vsl) cosmologies.  The intent of these tools is to help the researcher assess the strengths and weaknesses of specific vsl cosmologies and compare them to other vsl and non-vsl cosmologies.  The researcher will have the ability to construct and test new vsl cosmologies and/or reconfigure older cosmologies.  A set of currently available vsl cosmologies with a programmatic assessment of their strengths and weaknesses will be made available as a baseline for further development.  The tools are not intended to foster any particular vsl cosmology, nor any vsl cosmology at all, but rather to allow the researcher full control over the construction of such cosmologies and their assessments while using other tools made available from AstroPy and its affiliated packages.
